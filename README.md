# EvoImmunoPop_Splicing

The present folder contains all scripts from the manuscript entitled 
'Defining the genetic and evolutionary architecture of alternative splicing in response to infection'

These scripts are meant to provide additional transparency on the code underlying the results from the manuscript. 
However, these scripts are based on files that cannot be made publicly avaible, as some of them may contain sensitive genetic information. 
When possible we try to provide information on the content of the files and annotate the scripts to improve readability. 

Scripts are broken down by paragraph of the manuscripts and ordered following the flow of the manuscript.
Within each script, code used for generating figures and tables is highlighted . 

Note however that due to the computational nature of the analysis performed (some tables include several billions on lines)
the scripts may require high memory to be run, or parallelization through a cluster, and soime of the part of the analysis have been rewritten to improve clarity. 

Cleaning of the analysis scripts is still ongoing.
